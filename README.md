# Transcript_analysis
This repository contains the RNA-seq transcript-level analysis workflow used in my MSc research project.   The workflow focuses on **isoform quantification**, **differential isoform usage (DIU)**, and **functional interpretation** â€” with a case study on the **ATM gene** in a patient with Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID).
